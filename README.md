# FreshLinuxInstall

This is a shell script to help me quickly install packages that I need on a fresh Linux install. 

You probably don't want or need this, and that's okay. 

# Installation

To run this, you just need to run it as you would any other shell script. 

./packages.sh 

or

sh packages.sh

or 

bash packages.sh

# Why? 

Mostly as a matter of convenience for me. Like I said, you probably don't need this.
